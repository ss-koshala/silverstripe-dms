 * When storing a document, the DMS sucks up the file and stores it separately from the assets section.
 * When initializing the DMS, it should create some kind of storage system. For file-based storage, that could be
 * a series of folders. Within the folders there are a number of files, keeping the same filename, but prefixed with
 * an ID number, which corresponds to the document's ID. So "my-important-document" becomes:
 * "/4000/4332~my-important-document" (folder structure to avoid storing too many files within one folder. Perhaps
 * 10000 files per folder is a good amount)
